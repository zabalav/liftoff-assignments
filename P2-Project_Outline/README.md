## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our project is a product review site dedicated to non-alcoholic seltzers and sparkling waters. The heart of this web app is a broad database of such products. Users will be able to find and create product reviews, rate products, and log in to curate a personal list of favorites. They will also be able to find places to purchase products both online and at brick-and-mortar retailers.

This project was conceived with a desire to easily discover and remember drinks that are becoming steadily more popular and therefore more numerous.
